# funcr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `funcr` is to provide a consistent figure format via
`theme_sleek()` and a strait forward method for producing axis tick
marks and labels via `tickr()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ben-williams/funcr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(funcr)
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_sleek())
```
